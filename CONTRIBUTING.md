## Technical Contribution

### About the project

If you want to introduce a new feature or suggest code changes you need to
know the project's structure. The project is made with `django` and
`elasticsearch` as backend and `boostrap`, `javascript` and `css`  as
frontend. You can find an in-detail description of the project's structure in the
[docs](https://esquite.readthedocs.io/es/latest/estructura.html)

### Code style guide

* We use an `.editorconfig` file that you can use with your text editor
  installing a plugin. This helps us keep the coding style consistent.
  Installation  guides [here](https://editorconfig.org/#download).
* We follow the [pep 8 style guide for python code](https://pep8.org/) for
  `python` code.
* The `docstrings` follow the [Sphinx format](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html)
    * [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is the python
      documentation generator that we currently use to made our docs.

6. Push the branch on your fork and [create a pull
   request](#making-a-pull-request)
    * Include the issue number
    `fix(bug-1234): Fix some buggy code :p`

### Making a Pull Request

* TODO... explicit workflow of commits
* Consider using the pull request template
* If you don't want to use the template please consider at least these points
    * A short descriptive title of the changes
    * A summary of the features you are proposing or the bugs you are correcting
    * A mention to people that can review your code

## Non-technical Contributions

### Report a bug via issues

### Suggest a feature or enhancement

* Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.
* Describe the solution you'd like.
* Describe alternatives you've considered.
* Additional context.

### Corpus compilation

Part of our labor it's to enable NLP technologies through datasets like [TsuÃ±nkua](https://tsunkua.elotl.mx/).
To achieve this we need to collect monolingual or bilingual corpora in different
Mexican languages.

You can help us identifying, digitalizing and preprocessing books and materials
with monolingual or multilingual content. Currently we have open projects in the
next languages:

* Spanish-N√°huatl
* Spanish-Otom√≠
* Spanish-Mixteco
* Spanish-O'dam

However, we are in constant search of material in any languages pairs spoken in
Mexico. Are you interested? contact us üòÅ

### Diffusion

In addition to the task related to research and development of technologies we
maintain outreach activities of didactic material, events, initiatives, calls
for proposals, related with minority languages. Be part of our community and
help us to monitor relevant information to disseminate it through our social
networks.

Our blog is also open to collaborations related with technologies and languages
spoken in Mexico.
