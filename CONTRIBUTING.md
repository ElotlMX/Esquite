## Technical Contribution

### About the project

If you want to introduce a new feature or suggest code changes you need to
know the project's structure. The project is made with `django` and
`elasticsearch` as backend and `boostrap`, `javascript` and `css`  as
frontend. You can find an in-detail description of the project's structure in the
[docs](https://esquite.readthedocs.io/es/latest/estructura.html)

### Code style guide

* We use an `.editorconfig` file that you can use with your text editor
  installing a plugin. This helps us keep the coding style consistent.
  Installation  guides [here](https://editorconfig.org/#download).
* We follow the [pep 8 style guide for python code](https://pep8.org/) for
  `python` code.
* The `docstrings` follow the [Sphinx format](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html)
    * [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is the python
      documentation generator that we currently use to made our docs.
